I have been hearing about Inflation for the past few Months, and I have been curious as to how much the prices
of essential commodities have actually increased. Therefore, I decided to put my analytical skills to the test as an aspiring Data scientist
to come up with some hypothesis and answer them myself, verifying the hypothesis in the process. I have learned some interesting facts about the
city I have been living all my life, and also this analysis has broken some of my preconceived notions. Go thourugh some of the questions I answered in my analysis
in the tabs below.


### Questions I have on the dataset:
1. Which is more costly? Living in a tier 1 city (Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai) or a hill station or a island like port blair? How much is it better than the rest of the country? (quantify it)
    
2. How does the value of petrol affect the cost of prices of various kind?
    
3. What are the effects of pre and post covid rates? 
    
4. Which food item has the highest variation of cost beteen cities on average? Did it increase over the years, or is it getting smaller?

    4.1. Which commodity has increased in price by a lot? (quantify it)

5. Which of the vegetables (potato, tomato, onion) has a lot of fluctuations? Is it city dependent? (Coming Soon!)

    A lot of talk about inflation is frequenctly followed by the discussion on fuel prices. Hence, I would also 
    like to take that into account. However, similar to the commodity dataset, there is no ready made dataset for
    fuel prices in India. So, I used selenium to extract prices from [this website](https://www.mypetrolprice.com/5/Petrol-price-in-Chennai)

    This website is used to extract prices of petrol in the Chennai region from 2014, and since most often,
    the prices didn't vary to a large extent (it varied mostly in terms of less than a rupee, so not that significant), 
    we can impute the data using interpolation on both sides.

    These results show that like what we saw in question 2, oils are the main culprit for the high rates duing the covid era. 
    Another interesting find is that "Masoor Dal", whose value seem to have skyrocketed after 2020. We can hence conclude our question
    from the Section 2, and conclude that the price increase is not fuel dependent, but was primarily due to the issues caused by the

    1. There is certainly inflation, but it does have seem to have affected certain products like cooking oils and Masoor Dal.

    This chart shows the variation of the prices of commodities between the cities over the years. 
    
    As we can see, the prices can be categorised into 2 parts, where the standard deviation is less than 15 and another is 
    from 15 to 40.

    Over the years, we can see that the deviation has started to reduce and has geared towards the under 20 mark.
