# Inflationary Trends in Essential Commodity Prices: A Data-Driven Analysis

Welcome to my comprehensive analysis of inflationary trends in essential commodity prices.

As an aspiring data scientist, I have been intrigued by the recent discourse surrounding inflation and sought to empirically verify the veracity of the claims being made via a thorough examination of the available data. Through the application of advanced analytical techniques and rigorous hypothesis testing, I have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that drive inflation and how they impact the cost of living in different regions.

The scope of this analysis includes an examination of the relative cost of living in tier 1 cities as opposed to hill stations and island regions such as Port Blair, as well as an analysis of the relationship between petrol prices and the cost of various goods. Additionally, I have also examined the effects of pre and post-pandemic rates on commodity prices, and have conducted an in-depth study of the temporal and spatial variations in food costs, specifically focusing on the commodities which have witnessed a significant increase in price over time.
